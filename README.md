# monkey

This is my working repository for experimenting with interpreter/compiler creation. The base of the language is as laid out in Thorsten Bell's Writing an Interpeter in go, however there are various changes and improvements not outlined in the book:

- Reading and running from a file.
- While loop
- Greater/Less than or equal to infix operators
